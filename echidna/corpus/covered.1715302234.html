  87 |     | <span class='neutral'> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span>
  88 |     | <span class='neutral'> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span>
  89 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
  90 |     | <span class='neutral'>                            Preamble</span>
  91 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
  92 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</span>
  93 |     | <span class='neutral'>software and other kinds of works.</span>
  94 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
  95 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span>
  96 |     | <span class='neutral'>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</span>
  97 |     | <span class='neutral'>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</span>
  98 |     | <span class='neutral'>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</span>
  99 |     | <span class='neutral'>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</span>
 100 |     | <span class='neutral'>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</span>
 101 |     | <span class='neutral'>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</span>
 102 |     | <span class='neutral'>your programs, too.</span>
 103 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 104 |     | <span class='neutral'>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span>
 105 |     | <span class='neutral'>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span>
 106 |     | <span class='neutral'>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span>
 107 |     | <span class='neutral'>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span>
 108 |     | <span class='neutral'>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span>
 109 |     | <span class='neutral'>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span>
 110 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 111 |     | <span class='neutral'>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</span>
 112 |     | <span class='neutral'>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</span>
 113 |     | <span class='neutral'>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</span>
 114 |     | <span class='neutral'>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</span>
 115 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 116 |     | <span class='neutral'>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
 117 |     | <span class='neutral'>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</span>
 118 |     | <span class='neutral'>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</span>
 119 |     | <span class='neutral'>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</span>
 120 |     | <span class='neutral'>know their rights.</span>
 121 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 122 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</span>
 123 |     | <span class='neutral'>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</span>
 124 |     | <span class='neutral'>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</span>
 125 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 126 |     | <span class='neutral'>  For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains</span>
 127 |     | <span class='neutral'>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and</span>
 128 |     | <span class='neutral'>authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</span>
 129 |     | <span class='neutral'>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</span>
 130 |     | <span class='neutral'>authors of previous versions.</span>
 131 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 132 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</span>
 133 |     | <span class='neutral'>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</span>
 134 |     | <span class='neutral'>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</span>
 135 |     | <span class='neutral'>protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic</span>
 136 |     | <span class='neutral'>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</span>
 137 |     | <span class='neutral'>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</span>
 138 |     | <span class='neutral'>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</span>
 139 |     | <span class='neutral'>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</span>
 140 |     | <span class='neutral'>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</span>
 141 |     | <span class='neutral'>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span>
 142 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 143 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</span>
 144 |     | <span class='neutral'>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</span>
 145 |     | <span class='neutral'>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</span>
 146 |     | <span class='neutral'>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</span>
 147 |     | <span class='neutral'>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</span>
 148 |     | <span class='neutral'>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</span>
 149 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 150 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span>
 151 |     | <span class='neutral'>modification follow.</span>
 152 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 153 |     | <span class='neutral'>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>
 154 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 155 |     | <span class='neutral'>  0. Definitions.</span>
 156 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 157 |     | <span class='neutral'>  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</span>
 158 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 159 |     | <span class='neutral'>  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span>
 160 |     | <span class='neutral'>works, such as semiconductor masks.</span>
 161 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 162 |     | <span class='neutral'>  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span>
 163 |     | <span class='neutral'>License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</span>
 164 |     | <span class='neutral'>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</span>
 165 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 166 |     | <span class='neutral'>  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span>
 167 |     | <span class='neutral'>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</span>
 168 |     | <span class='neutral'>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</span>
 169 |     | <span class='neutral'>earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</span>
 170 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 171 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span>
 172 |     | <span class='neutral'>on the Program.</span>
 173 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 174 |     | <span class='neutral'>  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</span>
 175 |     | <span class='neutral'>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span>
 176 |     | <span class='neutral'>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span>
 177 |     | <span class='neutral'>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</span>
 178 |     | <span class='neutral'>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span>
 179 |     | <span class='neutral'>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</span>
 180 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 181 |     | <span class='neutral'>  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span>
 182 |     | <span class='neutral'>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</span>
 183 |     | <span class='neutral'>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span>
 184 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 185 |     | <span class='neutral'>  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</span>
 186 |     | <span class='neutral'>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span>
 187 |     | <span class='neutral'>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span>
 188 |     | <span class='neutral'>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span>
 189 |     | <span class='neutral'>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span>
 190 |     | <span class='neutral'>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</span>
 191 |     | <span class='neutral'>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span>
 192 |     | <span class='neutral'>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</span>
 193 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 194 |     | <span class='neutral'>  1. Source Code.</span>
 195 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 196 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</span>
 197 |     | <span class='neutral'>for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</span>
 198 |     | <span class='neutral'>form of a work.</span>
 199 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 200 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</span>
 201 |     | <span class='neutral'>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span>
 202 |     | <span class='neutral'>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span>
 203 |     | <span class='neutral'>is widely used among developers working in that language.</span>
 204 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 205 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</span>
 206 |     | <span class='neutral'>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</span>
 207 |     | <span class='neutral'>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span>
 208 |     | <span class='neutral'>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span>
 209 |     | <span class='neutral'>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span>
 210 |     | <span class='neutral'>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</span>
 211 |     | <span class='neutral'>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</span>
 212 |     | <span class='neutral'>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span>
 213 |     | <span class='neutral'>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span>
 214 |     | <span class='neutral'>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span>
 215 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 216 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</span>
 217 |     | <span class='neutral'>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span>
 218 |     | <span class='neutral'>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span>
 219 |     | <span class='neutral'>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s</span>
 220 |     | <span class='neutral'>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</span>
 221 |     | <span class='neutral'>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</span>
 222 |     | <span class='neutral'>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</span>
 223 |     | <span class='neutral'>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</span>
 224 |     | <span class='neutral'>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</span>
 225 |     | <span class='neutral'>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</span>
 226 |     | <span class='neutral'>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</span>
 227 |     | <span class='neutral'>subprograms and other parts of the work.</span>
 228 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 229 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</span>
 230 |     | <span class='neutral'>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</span>
 231 |     | <span class='neutral'>Source.</span>
 232 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 233 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</span>
 234 |     | <span class='neutral'>same work.</span>
 235 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 236 |     | <span class='neutral'>  2. Basic Permissions.</span>
 237 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 238 |     | <span class='neutral'>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</span>
 239 |     | <span class='neutral'>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</span>
 240 |     | <span class='neutral'>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</span>
 241 |     | <span class='neutral'>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</span>

 245 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 246 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</span>

 251 |     | <span class='neutral'>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</span>
 252 |     | <span class='neutral'>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</span>
 253 |     | <span class='neutral'>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</span>

 261 |     | <span class='neutral'>  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span>
 262 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 263 |     | <span class='neutral'>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</span>
 264 |     | <span class='neutral'>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</span>
 265 |     | <span class='neutral'>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</span>
 266 |     | <span class='neutral'>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</span>
 267 |     | <span class='neutral'>measures.</span>
 268 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 269 |     | <span class='neutral'>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span>
 270 |     | <span class='neutral'>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</span>
 271 |     | <span class='neutral'>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</span>
 272 |     | <span class='neutral'>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</span>
 273 |     | <span class='neutral'>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s</span>
 274 |     | <span class='neutral'>users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</span>
 275 |     | <span class='neutral'>technological measures.</span>

 277 |     | <span class='neutral'>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span>
 278 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 279 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</span>
 280 |     | <span class='neutral'>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</span>
 281 |     | <span class='neutral'>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</span>
 282 |     | <span class='neutral'>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</span>
 283 |     | <span class='neutral'>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</span>
 284 |     | <span class='neutral'>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</span>

 286 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 287 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</span>
 288 |     | <span class='neutral'>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span>
 289 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 290 |     | <span class='neutral'>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</span>
 291 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 292 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</span>
 293 |     | <span class='neutral'>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</span>
 294 |     | <span class='neutral'>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>
 295 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 296 |     | <span class='neutral'>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</span>
 297 |     | <span class='neutral'>    it, and giving a relevant date.</span>
 298 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 299 |     | <span class='neutral'>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</span>
 300 |     | <span class='neutral'>    released under this License and any conditions added under section</span>
 301 |     | <span class='neutral'>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</span>
 302 |     | <span class='neutral'>    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</span>
 303 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 304 |     | <span class='neutral'>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</span>
 305 |     | <span class='neutral'>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</span>
 306 |     | <span class='neutral'>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</span>
 307 |     | <span class='neutral'>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</span>
 308 |     | <span class='neutral'>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</span>
 309 |     | <span class='neutral'>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</span>
 310 |     | <span class='neutral'>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</span>
 311 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 312 |     | <span class='neutral'>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</span>
 313 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</span>
 314 |     | <span class='neutral'>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</span>
 315 |     | <span class='neutral'>    work need not make them do so.</span>
 316 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 317 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</span>
 318 |     | <span class='neutral'>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</span>
 319 |     | <span class='neutral'>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</span>
 320 |     | <span class='neutral'>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</span>
 321 |     | <span class='neutral'>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</span>
 322 |     | <span class='neutral'>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users</span>
 323 |     | <span class='neutral'>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</span>
 324 |     | <span class='neutral'>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</span>
 325 |     | <span class='neutral'>parts of the aggregate.</span>
 326 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 327 |     | <span class='neutral'>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span>
 328 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 329 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</span>
 330 |     | <span class='neutral'>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</span>
 331 |     | <span class='neutral'>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</span>
 332 |     | <span class='neutral'>in one of these ways:</span>
 333 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 334 |     | <span class='neutral'>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
 335 |     | <span class='neutral'>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</span>
 336 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</span>
 337 |     | <span class='neutral'>    customarily used for software interchange.</span>
 338 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 339 |     | <span class='neutral'>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
 340 |     | <span class='neutral'>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</span>
 341 |     | <span class='neutral'>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</span>
 342 |     | <span class='neutral'>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</span>
 343 |     | <span class='neutral'>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</span>
 344 |     | <span class='neutral'>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</span>
 345 |     | <span class='neutral'>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</span>
 346 |     | <span class='neutral'>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</span>
 347 |     | <span class='neutral'>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</span>
 348 |     | <span class='neutral'>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</span>
 349 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</span>
 350 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 351 |     | <span class='neutral'>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span>
 352 |     | <span class='neutral'>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</span>
 353 |     | <span class='neutral'>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</span>
 354 |     | <span class='neutral'>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</span>
 355 |     | <span class='neutral'>    with subsection 6b.</span>
 356 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 357 |     | <span class='neutral'>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</span>
 358 |     | <span class='neutral'>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</span>
 359 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</span>
 360 |     | <span class='neutral'>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</span>
 361 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</span>
 362 |     | <span class='neutral'>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</span>
 363 |     | <span class='neutral'>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</span>
 364 |     | <span class='neutral'>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</span>
 365 |     | <span class='neutral'>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span>
 366 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</span>
 367 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</span>
 368 |     | <span class='neutral'>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</span>
 369 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 370 |     | <span class='neutral'>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</span>
 371 |     | <span class='neutral'>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</span>
 372 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</span>
 373 |     | <span class='neutral'>    charge under subsection 6d.</span>
 374 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 375 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</span>
 376 |     | <span class='neutral'>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</span>
 377 |     | <span class='neutral'>included in conveying the object code work.</span>
 378 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 379 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</span>
 380 |     | <span class='neutral'>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</span>
 381 |     | <span class='neutral'>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</span>
 382 |     | <span class='neutral'>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</span>
 383 |     | <span class='neutral'>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</span>
 384 |     | <span class='neutral'>product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</span>
 385 |     | <span class='neutral'>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</span>
 386 |     | <span class='neutral'>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</span>
 387 |     | <span class='neutral'>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</span>
 388 |     | <span class='neutral'>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</span>
 389 |     | <span class='neutral'>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</span>
 390 |     | <span class='neutral'>the only significant mode of use of the product.</span>
 391 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 392 |     | <span class='neutral'>  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</span>
 393 |     | <span class='neutral'>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</span>
 394 |     | <span class='neutral'>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</span>
 395 |     | <span class='neutral'>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</span>
 396 |     | <span class='neutral'>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</span>
 397 |     | <span class='neutral'>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</span>
 398 |     | <span class='neutral'>modification has been made.</span>
 399 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 400 |     | <span class='neutral'>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span>
 401 |     | <span class='neutral'>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</span>
 402 |     | <span class='neutral'>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</span>
 403 |     | <span class='neutral'>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</span>
 404 |     | <span class='neutral'>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</span>
 405 |     | <span class='neutral'>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</span>
 406 |     | <span class='neutral'>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</span>
 407 |     | <span class='neutral'>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</span>
 408 |     | <span class='neutral'>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</span>
 409 |     | <span class='neutral'>been installed in ROM).</span>
 410 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 411 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span>
 412 |     | <span class='neutral'>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</span>
 413 |     | <span class='neutral'>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</span>
 414 |     | <span class='neutral'>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</span>
 415 |     | <span class='neutral'>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</span>
 416 |     | <span class='neutral'>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</span>
 417 |     | <span class='neutral'>protocols for communication across the network.</span>
 418 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 419 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</span>
 420 |     | <span class='neutral'>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</span>
 421 |     | <span class='neutral'>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</span>
 422 |     | <span class='neutral'>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</span>
 423 |     | <span class='neutral'>unpacking, reading or copying.</span>
 424 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 425 |     | <span class='neutral'>  7. Additional Terms.</span>
 426 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 427 |     | <span class='neutral'>  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</span>
 428 |     | <span class='neutral'>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</span>
 429 |     | <span class='neutral'>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</span>
 430 |     | <span class='neutral'>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</span>
 431 |     | <span class='neutral'>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</span>
 432 |     | <span class='neutral'>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</span>
 433 |     | <span class='neutral'>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</span>
 434 |     | <span class='neutral'>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</span>
 435 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 436 |     | <span class='neutral'>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</span>
 437 |     | <span class='neutral'>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</span>
 438 |     | <span class='neutral'>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</span>
 439 |     | <span class='neutral'>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</span>
 440 |     | <span class='neutral'>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</span>
 441 |     | <span class='neutral'>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</span>
 442 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 443 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</span>
 444 |     | <span class='neutral'>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</span>
 445 |     | <span class='neutral'>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span>
 446 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 447 |     | <span class='neutral'>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</span>
 448 |     | <span class='neutral'>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span>
 449 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 450 |     | <span class='neutral'>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</span>
 451 |     | <span class='neutral'>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</span>
 452 |     | <span class='neutral'>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</span>
 453 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 454 |     | <span class='neutral'>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</span>
 455 |     | <span class='neutral'>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</span>
 456 |     | <span class='neutral'>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</span>
 457 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 458 |     | <span class='neutral'>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</span>
 459 |     | <span class='neutral'>    authors of the material; or</span>
 460 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 461 |     | <span class='neutral'>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</span>

 463 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 464 |     | <span class='neutral'>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</span>
 465 |     | <span class='neutral'>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</span>
 466 |     | <span class='neutral'>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</span>
 467 |     | <span class='neutral'>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</span>
 468 |     | <span class='neutral'>    those licensors and authors.</span>
 469 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 470 |     | <span class='neutral'>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</span>
 471 |     | <span class='neutral'>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</span>
 472 |     | <span class='neutral'>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</span>
 473 |     | <span class='neutral'>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</span>
 474 |     | <span class='neutral'>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</span>
 475 |     | <span class='neutral'>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</span>
 476 |     | <span class='neutral'>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</span>
 477 |     | <span class='neutral'>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</span>
 478 |     | <span class='neutral'>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span>
 479 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 480 |     | <span class='neutral'>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</span>
 481 |     | <span class='neutral'>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</span>

 483 |     | <span class='neutral'>where to find the applicable terms.</span>
 484 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 485 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</span>
 486 |     | <span class='neutral'>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</span>
 487 |     | <span class='neutral'>the above requirements apply either way.</span>
 488 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 489 |     | <span class='neutral'>  8. Termination.</span>
 490 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 491 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</span>
 492 |     | <span class='neutral'>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</span>
 493 |     | <span class='neutral'>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</span>
 494 |     | <span class='neutral'>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</span>
 495 |     | <span class='neutral'>paragraph of section 11).</span>
 496 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 497 |     | <span class='neutral'>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</span>
 498 |     | <span class='neutral'>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</span>
 499 |     | <span class='neutral'>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</span>
 500 |     | <span class='neutral'>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</span>
 501 |     | <span class='neutral'>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</span>
 502 |     | <span class='neutral'>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</span>
 503 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 504 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</span>
 505 |     | <span class='neutral'>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</span>
 506 |     | <span class='neutral'>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</span>
 507 |     | <span class='neutral'>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</span>
 508 |     | <span class='neutral'>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</span>
 509 |     | <span class='neutral'>your receipt of the notice.</span>
 510 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 511 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</span>
 512 |     | <span class='neutral'>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</span>
 513 |     | <span class='neutral'>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</span>
 514 |     | <span class='neutral'>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</span>

 516 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 517 |     | <span class='neutral'>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span>
 518 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 519 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</span>
 520 |     | <span class='neutral'>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</span>
 521 |     | <span class='neutral'>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</span>
 522 |     | <span class='neutral'>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</span>
 523 |     | <span class='neutral'>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</span>
 524 |     | <span class='neutral'>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</span>
 525 |     | <span class='neutral'>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</span>
 526 |     | <span class='neutral'>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</span>
 527 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 528 |     | <span class='neutral'>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</span>
 529 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 530 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</span>
 531 |     | <span class='neutral'>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</span>
 532 |     | <span class='neutral'>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</span>
 533 |     | <span class='neutral'>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</span>
 534 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 535 |     | <span class='neutral'>  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</span>
 536 |     | <span class='neutral'>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span>
 537 |     | <span class='neutral'>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</span>
 538 |     | <span class='neutral'>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</span>
 539 |     | <span class='neutral'>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</span>
 540 |     | <span class='neutral'>licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could</span>
 541 |     | <span class='neutral'>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</span>
 542 |     | <span class='neutral'>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</span>
 543 |     | <span class='neutral'>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</span>
 544 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 545 |     | <span class='neutral'>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</span>
 546 |     | <span class='neutral'>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</span>
 547 |     | <span class='neutral'>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</span>
 548 |     | <span class='neutral'>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</span>
 549 |     | <span class='neutral'>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</span>
 550 |     | <span class='neutral'>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</span>
 551 |     | <span class='neutral'>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</span>
 552 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 553 |     | <span class='neutral'>  11. Patents.</span>
 554 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 555 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</span>
 556 |     | <span class='neutral'>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</span>
 557 |     | <span class='neutral'>work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</span>
 558 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 559 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</span>
 560 |     | <span class='neutral'>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</span>
 561 |     | <span class='neutral'>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</span>
 562 |     | <span class='neutral'>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</span>
 563 |     | <span class='neutral'>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</span>
 564 |     | <span class='neutral'>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</span>
 565 |     | <span class='neutral'>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</span>
 566 |     | <span class='neutral'>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</span>
 567 |     | <span class='neutral'>this License.</span>
 568 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 569 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</span>
 570 |     | <span class='neutral'>patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to</span>
 571 |     | <span class='neutral'>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</span>
 572 |     | <span class='neutral'>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</span>
 573 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 574 |     | <span class='neutral'>  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</span>
 575 |     | <span class='neutral'>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</span>
 576 |     | <span class='neutral'>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</span>
 577 |     | <span class='neutral'>sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</span>
 578 |     | <span class='neutral'>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</span>
 579 |     | <span class='neutral'>patent against the party.</span>

 581 |     | <span class='neutral'>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</span>
 582 |     | <span class='neutral'>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</span>
 583 |     | <span class='neutral'>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</span>
 584 |     | <span class='neutral'>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</span>
 585 |     | <span class='neutral'>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</span>
 586 |     | <span class='neutral'>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</span>
 587 |     | <span class='neutral'>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</span>
 588 |     | <span class='neutral'>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</span>
 589 |     | <span class='neutral'>license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</span>
 590 |     | <span class='neutral'>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</span>
 591 |     | <span class='neutral'>covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work</span>
 592 |     | <span class='neutral'>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</span>
 593 |     | <span class='neutral'>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</span>
 594 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 595 |     | <span class='neutral'>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</span>
 596 |     | <span class='neutral'>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</span>
 597 |     | <span class='neutral'>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</span>
 598 |     | <span class='neutral'>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</span>
 599 |     | <span class='neutral'>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</span>
 600 |     | <span class='neutral'>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</span>
 601 |     | <span class='neutral'>work and works based on it.</span>
 602 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 603 |     | <span class='neutral'>  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</span>
 604 |     | <span class='neutral'>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</span>
 605 |     | <span class='neutral'>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</span>
 606 |     | <span class='neutral'>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</span>
 607 |     | <span class='neutral'>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</span>
 608 |     | <span class='neutral'>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</span>
 609 |     | <span class='neutral'>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</span>
 610 |     | <span class='neutral'>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</span>
 611 |     | <span class='neutral'>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</span>
 612 |     | <span class='neutral'>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</span>
 613 |     | <span class='neutral'>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</span>
 614 |     | <span class='neutral'>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</span>
 615 |     | <span class='neutral'>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</span>
 616 |     | <span class='neutral'>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span>
 617 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 618 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</span>
 619 |     | <span class='neutral'>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</span>
 620 |     | <span class='neutral'>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</span>
 621 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 622 |     | <span class='neutral'>  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.</span>
 623 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 624 |     | <span class='neutral'>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
 625 |     | <span class='neutral'>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span>
 626 |     | <span class='neutral'>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</span>
 627 |     | <span class='neutral'>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span>
 628 |     | <span class='neutral'>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</span>
 629 |     | <span class='neutral'>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</span>
 630 |     | <span class='neutral'>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</span>
 631 |     | <span class='neutral'>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</span>
 632 |     | <span class='neutral'>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</span>
 633 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 634 |     | <span class='neutral'>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</span>
 635 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>

 638 |     | <span class='neutral'>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</span>
 639 |     | <span class='neutral'>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</span>
 640 |     | <span class='neutral'>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</span>
 641 |     | <span class='neutral'>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</span>

 645 |     | <span class='neutral'>  14. Revised Versions of this License.</span>
 646 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 647 |     | <span class='neutral'>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</span>

 651 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 652 |     | <span class='neutral'>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</span>

 661 |     | <span class='neutral'>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</span>

 710 |     | <span class='neutral'></span>
 711 |     | <span class='neutral'>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</span>
 712 |     | <span class='neutral'>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
